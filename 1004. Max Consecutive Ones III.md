# Max Consecutive Ones III

## Problem Statement

Given a binary array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array if you can flip at most `k` 0's.

### Examples

#### Example 1

- **Input:** `nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0]`, `k = 2`
- **Output:** `6`
- **Explanation:** The bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined:
  - `[1,1,1,0,0,**1**,1,1,1,1,**1**]`

#### Example 2

- **Input:** `nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]`, `k = 3`
- **Output:** `10`
- **Explanation:** The bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined:
  - `[0,0,1,1,**1**,**1**,1,1,1,**1**,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]`

### Constraints

- \(1 \leq nums.length \leq 10^5\)
- `nums[i]` is either 0 or 1.
- \(0 \leq k \leq nums.length\)

## Solutions

### Java Solution

The Java solution uses a sliding window approach to find the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array. This method efficiently handles the constraints by adjusting the window size dynamically.

```java
class Solution {
    public int longestOnes(int[] nums, int k) {
        int l = 0, r = 0, max = 0, n = nums.length;
        
        while (r < n) { 
            if (nums[r] == 0) k--;
            if (k < 0) {
                if (nums[l] == 0) k++;
                l++;                
            }
            max = Math.max(max, r - l + 1);
            r++;
        }
        
        return max;
    }
}
```

### JavaScript Solution

The JavaScript solution also employs a sliding window technique to maximize the number of consecutive 1's by flipping at most `k` 0's.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {number}
 */
var longestOnes = function(nums, k) {
    let l = 0, r = 0, max = 0, n = nums.length;
    
    while (r < n) { 
        if (nums[r] == 0) k--;
        if (k < 0) {
            if (nums[l] == 0) k++;
            l++;                
        }
        max = Math.max(max, r - l + 1);
        r++;
    }
    
    return max;
};
```

## Approach

### Intuition

To find the maximum number of consecutive 1's in a binary array after flipping at most `k` 0's, we can utilize a sliding window approach. This approach allows us to efficiently adjust the window size and maintain the count of flipped 0's.

### Steps

1. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize two pointers, `l` and `r`, to represent the left and right ends of the window.
   - Initialize `max` to track the maximum number of consecutive 1's found.
   - Initialize `k` to the number of flips allowed.

2. **Sliding Window:**
   - Expand the window by moving the right pointer, `r`.
   - If a 0 is encountered, decrease `k` by 1.
   - If `k` becomes negative (more than allowed flips), shrink the window from the left by moving the left pointer, `l`, and restore `k` when a 0 is passed.
   - Update `max` with the maximum length of the window found so far.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\) since each element in the array is processed at most twice (once by the left pointer and once by the right pointer).

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity is \(O(1)\) as only a few variables are used for calculations.

## Example and Dry Run

Let's go through a dry run of the JavaScript solution with Example 1:

**Input:** `nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0]`, `k = 2`
**Output:** `6`

### Steps

1. **Initialization:**
   - `l = 0`, `r = 0`, `max = 0`, `n = 11`
   
2. **Sliding Window:**
   - Window: `[1]`, `r = 0`, `k = 2`, `max = 1`
   - Window: `[1, 1]`, `r = 1`, `k = 2`, `max = 2`
   - Window: `[1, 1, 1]`, `r = 2`, `k = 2`, `max = 3`
   - Window: `[1, 1, 1, 0]`, `r = 3`, `k = 1`, `max = 4`
   - Window: `[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]`, `r = 4`, `k = 0`, `max = 5`
   - Window: `[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]`, `r = 5`, `k = -1`
     - Adjust window: `l = 1`, `k = 0`
   - Window: `[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]`, `r = 6`, `k = 0`, `max = 6`
   - Continue adjusting window until `r` reaches the end

This demonstrates that the function works correctly for the given example.

## Conclusion

By using a sliding window approach, we can efficiently find the maximum number of consecutive 1's after flipping at most `k` 0's. This method ensures optimal performance with a time complexity of \(O(n)\) and minimal space usage, making it suitable for large input sizes.
