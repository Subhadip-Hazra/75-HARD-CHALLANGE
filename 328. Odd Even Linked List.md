# Odd Even Linked List

## Problem Statement

Given the head of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return the reordered list.

The first node is considered odd, and the second node is even, and so on.

Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.

You must solve the problem in \(O(1)\) extra space complexity and \(O(n)\) time complexity.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**
```
head = [1,2,3,4,5]
```

**Output:**
```
[1,3,5,2,4]
```

**Explanation:**
- The nodes with odd indices are [1, 3, 5].
- The nodes with even indices are [2, 4].
- Combining these groups, the reordered list is [1, 3, 5, 2, 4].

### Example 2

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/y6jYSkvW/oddeven2-linked-list.jpg" alt="example2" width="600">

**Input:**
```
head = [2,1,3,5,6,4,7]
```

**Output:**
```
[2,3,6,7,1,5,4]
```

**Explanation:**
- The nodes with odd indices are [2, 3, 6, 7].
- The nodes with even indices are [1, 5, 4].
- Combining these groups, the reordered list is [2, 3, 6, 7, 1, 5, 4].

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the linked list is in the range [0, 10^4].
- -10^6 <= Node.val <= 10^6

## Approach

To reorder the linked list as per the given requirements, we can use the following approach:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Create two pointers: `odd` and `even`.
   - `odd` will point to the first node (head).
   - `even` will point to the second node (head.next).
   - Keep a reference to the start of the even list with `evenHead`.

2. **Reordering:**
   - Traverse the list with both pointers.
   - Rearrange the pointers to group all odd nodes together and all even nodes together.
   - Link the last odd node to the first even node.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the list is empty or has only one node, return the head as it is.

4. **Time Complexity:**
   - We traverse the list once, so the time complexity is \(O(n)\).

5. **Space Complexity:**
   - We use a constant amount of extra space, so the space complexity is \(O(1)\).

## Solutions

### Java Solution

Here's the Java implementation for the `oddEvenList` method:

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode oddEvenList(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null) return null;

        ListNode odd = head;
        ListNode even = head.next;
        ListNode evenHead = even;

        while (even != null && even.next != null) {
            odd.next = odd.next.next;
            even.next = even.next.next;
            odd = odd.next;
            even = even.next;
        }

        odd.next = evenHead;
        return head;
    }
}

/**
 * Usage example:
 * Solution sol = new Solution();
 * ListNode head = new ListNode(1, new ListNode(2, new ListNode(3, new ListNode(4, new ListNode(5)))));
 * head = sol.oddEvenList(head);
 */
```

### JavaScript Solution

Here's the JavaScript implementation for the `oddEvenList` method:

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val, next) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val);
 *     this.next = (next===undefined ? null : next);
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {ListNode} head
 * @return {ListNode}
 */
var oddEvenList = function(head) {
    if (head === null) return null;

    let odd = head;
    let even = head.next;
    let evenHead = even;

    while (even !== null && even.next !== null) {
        odd.next = odd.next.next;
        even.next = even.next.next;
        odd = odd.next;
        even = even.next;
    }

    odd.next = evenHead;
    return head;
};

/**
 * Usage example:
 * const head = new ListNode(1, new ListNode(2, new ListNode(3, new ListNode(4, new ListNode(5)))));
 * const newHead = oddEvenList(head);
 */
```

## Explanation and Dry Run

### Java Solution Dry Run

1. **Initialization:**
   - `ListNode odd = head;`
   - `ListNode even = head.next;`
   - `ListNode evenHead = even;`

2. **Traversing and Reordering:**
   - Rearrange pointers to group odd and even indexed nodes.
   - Continue until the end of the list is reached.

3. **Combining Lists:**
   - Link the last odd node to the head of the even list: `odd.next = evenHead;`

4. **Return:**
   - Return the modified head of the list.

## Conclusion

Both the Java and JavaScript solutions effectively group all odd-indexed nodes together followed by even-indexed nodes in a singly linked list using a two-pointer technique. This ensures an efficient \(O(n)\) time complexity with \(O(1)\) extra space complexity, making the solutions suitable for the given constraints.
