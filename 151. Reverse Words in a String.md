# 151. Reverse Words in a String

## Problem Statement

Given an input string `s`, reverse the order of the words. A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in `s` will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order, concatenated by a single space. Note that `s` may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words and should not include any extra spaces.

### Examples

#### Example 1

- **Input:** `s = "the sky is blue"`
- **Output:** `blue is sky the`

#### Example 2

- **Input:** `s = "  hello world  "`
- **Output:** `world hello`
- **Explanation:** Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.

#### Example 3

- **Input:** `s = "a good   example"`
- **Output:** `example good a`
- **Explanation:** You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.

### Constraints

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^4`
- `s` contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces `' '`.
- There is at least one word in `s`.

## Solution

### Java Solution

The Java solution involves trimming the input string, splitting it by spaces, reversing the order of the words, and then joining them with a single space.

```java
class Solution {
    public String reverseWords(String s) {
        String[] array = s.trim().split("\\s+");
        int start = 0;
        int end = array.length - 1;

        // Reverse the array of words
        while (start < end) {
            String temp = array[start];
            array[start] = array[end];
            array[end] = temp;
            start++;
            end--;
        }
        return String.join(" ", array);
    }
}
```

### JavaScript Solution

The JavaScript solution follows a similar approach by trimming the input string, splitting it by spaces, reversing the order of the words, and then joining them with a single space.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string}
 */
var reverseWords = function(s) {
    let array = s.trim().split(/\s+/);

    let start = 0, end = array.length - 1;

    // Reverse the array of words
    while (start < end) {
        let temp = array[start];
        array[start] = array[end];
        array[end] = temp;
        start++;
        end--;
    }

    return array.join(" ");
};
```

## Approach

### Intuition

To reverse the order of words in a string, we need to:
1. Remove leading and trailing spaces.
2. Split the string into words by spaces.
3. Reverse the order of the words.
4. Join the words with a single space.

### Steps

1. **Trim the String:**
   - Use `trim()` to remove leading and trailing spaces.

2. **Split the String:**
   - Split the string into an array of words using `split("\\s+")` in Java or `split(/\s+/)` in JavaScript to handle multiple spaces between words.

3. **Reverse the Words:**
   - Reverse the array of words in place.

4. **Join the Words:**
   - Join the reversed array of words with a single space.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input string. This includes trimming, splitting, reversing, and joining the words.

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity is \(O(n)\) due to the additional array used to store the words.

## Conclusion

This approach ensures that we efficiently reverse the order of words in the given string while handling multiple spaces and leading/trailing spaces correctly. The implementation is straightforward and maintains both time and space efficiency.

## Example and Dry Run

Let's go through a dry run of the JavaScript solution with Example 1:

**Input:** `s = "the sky is blue"`
**Output:** `blue is sky the`

### Steps

1. **Trim the String:**
   - `s = "the sky is blue"`

2. **Split the String:**
   - `array = ["the", "sky", "is", "blue"]`

3. **Reverse the Words:**
   - `array = ["blue", "is", "sky", "the"]`

4. **Join the Words:**
   - `result = "blue is sky the"`

This demonstrates that the function works correctly for the given example.
