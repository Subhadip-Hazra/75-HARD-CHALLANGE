# Maximum Number of Vowels in a Substring of Given Length

## Problem Statement

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, return the maximum number of vowel letters in any substring of `s` with length `k`.

Vowel letters in English are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'.

### Examples

#### Example 1

- **Input:** `s = "abciiidef"`, `k = 3`
- **Output:** `3`
- **Explanation:** The substring `"iii"` contains 3 vowel letters.

#### Example 2

- **Input:** `s = "aeiou"`, `k = 2`
- **Output:** `2`
- **Explanation:** Any substring of length 2 contains 2 vowels.

#### Example 3

- **Input:** `s = "leetcode"`, `k = 3`
- **Output:** `2`
- **Explanation:** `"lee"`, `"eet"`, and `"ode"` contain 2 vowels.

### Constraints

- \(1 \leq s.length \leq 10^5\)
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
- \(1 \leq k \leq s.length\)

## Solutions

### Java Solution

The Java solution uses a sliding window approach to keep track of the number of vowels in the current window of length `k`. It updates the count as the window slides through the string.

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxVowels(String s, int k) {
        String vowels = "aeiou";
        int max = 0, count = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            if (vowels.indexOf(s.charAt(i)) != -1) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        max = count;
        
        for (int i = k; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (vowels.indexOf(s.charAt(i - k)) != -1) {
                count--;
            }
            if (vowels.indexOf(s.charAt(i)) != -1) {
                count++;
            }
            max = Math.max(max, count);
        }
        
        return max;
    }
}
```

### JavaScript Solution

The JavaScript solution also employs a sliding window technique to count the vowels within each window of length `k` and updates the maximum count accordingly.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxVowels = function(s, k) {
    const vowels = "aeiou";
    let count = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        if (vowels.indexOf(s[i]) != -1) count++;
    }
    let max = count;
    
    for (let i = k; i < s.length; i++) {
        if (vowels.indexOf(s[i - k]) != -1) count--;
        if (vowels.indexOf(s[i]) != -1) count++;
        max = Math.max(max, count);
    }
    
    return max;
};
```

## Approach

### Intuition

To find the maximum number of vowels in any substring of length `k`, we can utilize a sliding window approach. This allows us to efficiently count and update the number of vowels as the window slides through the string.

### Steps

1. **Initial Count:**
   - Calculate the number of vowels in the initial window of length `k`.
   
2. **Sliding Window:**
   - Slide the window from the start to the end of the string.
   - Update the count of vowels by removing the effect of the character going out of the window and adding the effect of the character coming into the window.
   - Track the maximum count of vowels found during the sliding process.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\) since each character in the string is processed once during the sliding window traversal.

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity is \(O(1)\) as only a few variables are used for calculations.

## Example and Dry Run

Let's go through a dry run of the JavaScript solution with Example 1:

**Input:** `s = "abciiidef"`, `k = 3`
**Output:** `3`

### Steps

1. **Initial Count:**
   - Initial count of vowels in the first `k` elements: \("a", "b", "c" -> count = 1\)

2. **Sliding Window:**
   - Slide the window to include the next element:
     - Substring "bci" -> count = 1
   - Slide the window to include the next element:
     - Substring "cii" -> count = 2
   - Slide the window to include the next element:
     - Substring "iii" -> count = 3
     - `max = 3`
   - Slide the window to include the next element:
     - Substring "iie" -> count = 2
   - Slide the window to include the next element:
     - Substring "ief" -> count = 2

3. **Calculate the Maximum Vowels:**
   - `max = 3`

This demonstrates that the function works correctly for the given example.

## Conclusion

By using a sliding window approach, we can efficiently find the maximum number of vowels in any substring of length `k`. This method ensures optimal performance with a time complexity of \(O(n)\) and minimal space usage, making it suitable for large input sizes.
