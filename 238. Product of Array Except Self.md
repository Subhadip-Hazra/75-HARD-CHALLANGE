# Product of Array Except Self

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in \(O(n)\) time and without using the division operation.

### Examples

#### Example 1

- **Input:** `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
- **Output:** `[24, 12, 8, 6]`

#### Example 2

- **Input:** `nums = [-1, 1, 0, -3, 3]`
- **Output:** `[0, 0, 9, 0, 0]`

### Constraints

- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-30 <= nums[i] <= 30`
- The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

## Solution

### Java Solution

The Java solution involves creating an array `ans` where each element at index `i` contains the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`. This is achieved in two passes: one from left to right and another from right to left, to calculate the prefix and suffix products.

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] productExceptSelf(int[] nums) {
        int product = 1;
        int[] ans = new int[nums.length];
        
        // Calculate prefix products
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            ans[i] = product;
            product *= nums[i];
        }

        product = 1;
        // Calculate suffix products and multiply with prefix products
        for (int i = nums.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            ans[i] *= product;
            product *= nums[i];
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
}
```

### JavaScript Solution

The JavaScript solution follows the same logic as the Java solution, using two passes to compute the prefix and suffix products, and then combining them.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var productExceptSelf = function(nums) {
    let product = 1;
    let ans = new Array(nums.length);

    // Calculate prefix products
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        ans[i] = product;
        product *= nums[i];
    }

    product = 1;
    // Calculate suffix products and multiply with prefix products
    for (let i = nums.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        ans[i] *= product;
        product *= nums[i];
    }

    return ans;
};
```

## Approach

### Intuition

To determine the product of all elements except the current one without using division, we can break the problem into two parts:
1. Calculate the product of all elements to the left of each index.
2. Calculate the product of all elements to the right of each index.

By multiplying these two products for each index, we get the desired result.

### Steps

1. **Initialize Arrays:**
   - Create an array `ans` to store the result.

2. **Calculate Prefix Products:**
   - Traverse the array from left to right, maintaining a running product of all elements to the left of the current index.

3. **Calculate Suffix Products:**
   - Traverse the array from right to left, maintaining a running product of all elements to the right of the current index.
   - Multiply the prefix product with the suffix product for each index and store the result in `ans`.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of the solution is \(O(n)\) because we traverse the array twice.

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity is \(O(1)\) extra space for the algorithm itself, as we only use the `ans` array to store the result which does not count towards extra space complexity as it is required output.

## Conclusion

This approach efficiently calculates the product of array elements except for the current index in \(O(n)\) time without using division. It maintains optimal space complexity, ensuring scalability for large inputs.

## Example and Dry Run

Let's go through a dry run of the JavaScript solution with Example 1:

**Input:** `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
**Output:** `[24, 12, 8, 6]`

### Steps

1. **Calculate Prefix Products:**
   - `ans = [1, 1, 2, 6]`
   - After first pass: `product = 1, 1, 2, 6`

2. **Calculate Suffix Products and Multiply:**
   - `ans = [24, 12, 8, 6]`
   - After second pass: `product = 1, 4, 12, 24`

This demonstrates that the function works correctly for the given example.
