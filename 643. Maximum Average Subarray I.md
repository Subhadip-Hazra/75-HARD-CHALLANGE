# Maximum Average Subarray I

## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` consisting of `n` elements, and an integer `k`.

Find a contiguous subarray whose length is equal to `k` that has the maximum average value and return this value. Any answer with a calculation error less than \(10^{-5}\) will be accepted.

### Examples

#### Example 1

- **Input:** `nums = [1, 12, -5, -6, 50, 3]`, `k = 4`
- **Output:** `12.75000`
- **Explanation:** 
  - Maximum average is \((12 - 5 - 6 + 50) / 4 = 51 / 4 = 12.75\)

#### Example 2

- **Input:** `nums = [5]`, `k = 1`
- **Output:** `5.00000`

### Constraints

- \( n == nums.length \)
- \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^5 \)
- \( -10^4 \leq nums[i] \leq 10^4 \)

## Solutions

### Java Solution

The Java solution uses a sliding window approach to find the maximum average subarray. It first calculates the sum of the initial subarray of length `k`, then slides the window across the array to find the maximum sum.

```java
class Solution {
    public double findMaxAverage(int[] nums, int k) {
        int sum = 0, maxSum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            sum += nums[i];
        }
        maxSum = sum;
        for (int i = k; i < nums.length; i++) {
            sum += nums[i] - nums[i - k];
            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, sum);
        }
        return (double) maxSum / k;
    }
}
```

### JavaScript Solution

The JavaScript solution also employs a sliding window technique to compute the maximum average subarray. It initializes the sum of the first `k` elements and updates the sum while traversing the array.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {number}
 */
var findMaxAverage = function(nums, k) {
    let sum = 0, maxSum = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        sum += nums[i];
    }
    maxSum = sum;
    for (let i = k; i < nums.length; i++) {
        sum += nums[i] - nums[i - k];
        maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, sum);
    }
    return maxSum * 1.000 / k;
};
```

## Approach

### Intuition

To find the maximum average subarray of length `k`, we need to efficiently compute the sum of all possible subarrays of length `k` and keep track of the maximum sum found. The sliding window technique is ideal for this purpose, allowing us to update the sum by adding the next element in the window and subtracting the first element of the previous window.

### Steps

1. **Initialize the Sum:**
   - Calculate the sum of the first `k` elements.
   
2. **Sliding Window:**
   - Slide the window from the start to the end of the array.
   - Update the sum by subtracting the element going out of the window and adding the element coming into the window.
   - Track the maximum sum found during the sliding process.

3. **Calculate the Maximum Average:**
   - The maximum average is the maximum sum divided by `k`.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\) since each element is processed once during the sliding window traversal.

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity is \(O(1)\) as only a few variables are used for calculations.

## Example and Dry Run

Let's go through a dry run of the JavaScript solution with Example 1:

**Input:** `nums = [1, 12, -5, -6, 50, 3]`, `k = 4`
**Output:** `12.75000`

### Steps

1. **Initialize the Sum:**
   - Initial sum of first `k` elements: \(1 + 12 - 5 - 6 = 2\)
   - `maxSum = 2`

2. **Sliding Window:**
   - Slide the window to include the next element:
     - `sum += 50 - 1` -> `sum = 51`
     - `maxSum = 51`
   - Slide the window to include the next element:
     - `sum += 3 - 12` -> `sum = 42`
     - `maxSum = 51` (no change)

3. **Calculate the Maximum Average:**
   - `maxAverage = maxSum / k = 51 / 4 = 12.75`

This demonstrates that the function works correctly for the given example.
