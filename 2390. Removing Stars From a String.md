# Removing Stars From a String

## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` that contains stars `*`.

In one operation, you can:
- Choose a star in `s`.
- Remove the closest non-star character to its left, as well as remove the star itself.

Return the string after all stars have been removed.

**Note:**
- The input will be generated such that the operation is always possible.
- It can be shown that the resulting string will always be unique.

### Examples

#### Example 1

- **Input:** `s = "leet**cod*e"`
- **Output:** `"lecoe"`
- **Explanation:**
  - Performing the removals from left to right:
    - The closest character to the 1st star is `'t'` in `"leet**cod*e"`. `s` becomes `"lee*cod*e"`.
    - The closest character to the 2nd star is `'e'` in `"lee*cod*e"`. `s` becomes `"lecod*e"`.
    - The closest character to the 3rd star is `'d'` in `"lecod*e"`. `s` becomes `"lecoe"`.
  - There are no more stars, so we return `"lecoe"`.

#### Example 2

- **Input:** `s = "erase*****"`
- **Output:** `""`
- **Explanation:** The entire string is removed, so we return an empty string.

### Constraints

- \( 1 \leq s.length \leq 10^5 \)
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters and stars `*`.
- The operation above can be performed on `s`.

## Solutions

### Java Solution

The Java solution uses a stack to handle the removal of characters based on the presence of stars.

```java
import java.util.Stack;

class Solution {
    public String removeStars(String s) {
        Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (ch == '*') {
                stack.pop();
            } else {
                stack.push(ch);
            }
        }
        for (char ch : stack) {
            sb.append(ch);
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```

### JavaScript Solution

The JavaScript solution also utilizes a stack to manage character removals efficiently.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string}
 */
var removeStars = function(s) {
    let stack = [];

    for (let ch of s) {
        if (ch === '*') {
            stack.pop();
        } else {
            stack.push(ch);
        }
    }

    const ans = stack.join('');
    return ans;
};
```

## Approach

### Intuition

To solve the problem of removing stars and the closest non-star characters to their left, we can use a stack:
1. Traverse through each character of the string.
2. If the character is a star `*`, pop the top character from the stack (removing the closest non-star character).
3. If the character is not a star, push it onto the stack.
4. After processing all characters, the stack will contain the resulting string without any stars.

### Steps

1. **Initialize a Stack:** Use a stack to keep track of characters.
2. **Traverse the String:**
   - For each character:
     - If it is a star `*`, pop the top element from the stack.
     - If it is not a star, push it onto the stack.
3. **Build the Result:** Convert the stack to a string and return it.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity is \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the length of the string `s`. Each character is processed once.

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity is \( O(n) \) in the worst case, where all characters are pushed onto the stack (when there are no stars).

## Example and Dry Run

Let's go through a dry run of both the Java and JavaScript solutions with Example 1:

**Input:** `s = "leet**cod*e"`
**Output:** `"lecoe"`

### Java Dry Run

**Initialization:**
- `stack = []`
- `sb = ""`

**Processing:**
1. `s[0] = 'l'` → `stack = ['l']`
2. `s[1] = 'e'` → `stack = ['l', 'e']`
3. `s[2] = 'e'` → `stack = ['l', 'e', 'e']`
4. `s[3] = 't'` → `stack = ['l', 'e', 'e', 't']`
5. `s[4] = '*'` → `stack = ['l', 'e', 'e']`
6. `s[5] = '*'` → `stack = ['l', 'e']`
7. `s[6] = 'c'` → `stack = ['l', 'e', 'c']`
8. `s[7] = 'o'` → `stack = ['l', 'e', 'c', 'o']`
9. `s[8] = 'd'` → `stack = ['l', 'e', 'c', 'o', 'd']`
10. `s[9] = '*'` → `stack = ['l', 'e', 'c', 'o']`
11. `s[10] = 'e'` → `stack = ['l', 'e', 'c', 'o', 'e']`

**Result:**
- Convert `stack` to string: `"lecoe"`

## Conclusion

The provided solutions efficiently handle the removal of stars and the closest non-star characters from a string using a stack-based approach. Both the Java and JavaScript implementations ensure optimal performance within the given constraints.
