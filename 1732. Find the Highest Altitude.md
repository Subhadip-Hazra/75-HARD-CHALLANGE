# Find the Highest Altitude

## Problem Statement

There is a biker going on a road trip. The road trip consists of `n + 1` points at different altitudes. The biker starts his trip on point 0 with an altitude equal to 0.

You are given an integer array `gain` of length `n` where `gain[i]` is the net gain in altitude between points `i` and `i + 1` for all `0 <= i < n`. Return the highest altitude of a point.

### Examples

#### Example 1

- **Input:** `gain = [-5, 1, 5, 0, -7]`
- **Output:** `1`
- **Explanation:** The altitudes are `[0, -5, -4, 1, 1, -6]`. The highest is `1`.

#### Example 2

- **Input:** `gain = [-4, -3, -2, -1, 4, 3, 2]`
- **Output:** `0`
- **Explanation:** The altitudes are `[0, -4, -7, -9, -10, -6, -3, -1]`. The highest is `0`.

### Constraints

- `n == gain.length`
- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `-100 <= gain[i] <= 100`

## Solutions

### Java Solution

The Java solution iterates through the `gain` array to calculate the cumulative altitude at each point and keeps track of the highest altitude encountered.

```java
class Solution {
    public int largestAltitude(int[] gain) {
        int max = 0, dist = 0;

        for (int g : gain) {
            dist += g;
            if (max < dist) {
                max = dist;
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```

### JavaScript Solution

The JavaScript solution also iterates through the `gain` array, computing the cumulative altitude and keeping track of the highest altitude encountered.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} gain
 * @return {number}
 */
var largestAltitude = function(gain) {
    let max = 0, dist = 0;

    for (let g of gain) {
        dist += g;
        if (max < dist) {
            max = dist;
        } 
    }
    return max;
};
```

## Approach

### Intuition

To find the highest altitude, we need to compute the cumulative sum of the `gain` array at each step and keep track of the maximum altitude reached. The biker starts at an altitude of `0`.

### Steps

1. **Initialization:**
   - Start with an initial altitude `dist` set to `0`.
   - Initialize `max` to `0` to track the highest altitude.

2. **Iteration:**
   - Iterate through each element `g` in the `gain` array.
   - Update the current altitude `dist` by adding `g` to it.
   - Update `max` if the current altitude `dist` is higher than `max`.

3. **Return:**
   - After processing all elements in the `gain` array, return the highest altitude stored in `max`.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the `gain` array, since we are iterating through the array once.

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity is \(O(1)\) because we are using a constant amount of extra space.

## Example and Dry Run

Let's go through a dry run with Example 1:

**Input:** `gain = [-5, 1, 5, 0, -7]`
**Output:** `1`

### Steps

1. **Initialization:**
   - `dist = 0`, `max = 0`

2. **Iteration:**
   - `gain[0] = -5`: `dist = -5`, `max = 0`
   - `gain[1] = 1`: `dist = -4`, `max = 0`
   - `gain[2] = 5`: `dist = 1`, `max = 1`
   - `gain[3] = 0`: `dist = 1`, `max = 1`
   - `gain[4] = -7`: `dist = -6`, `max = 1`

3. **Return:**
   - The highest altitude reached is `1`.

## Conclusion

This problem can be efficiently solved using a single-pass iteration to compute the cumulative altitude and keep track of the highest altitude encountered. Both the Java and JavaScript solutions provided demonstrate this approach, ensuring optimal performance and minimal space usage.
