# Max Number of K-Sum Pairs

## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.

In one operation, you can pick two numbers from the array whose sum equals `k` and remove them from the array.

Return the maximum number of operations you can perform on the array.

### Examples

#### Example 1

- **Input:** `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, `k = 5`
- **Output:** `2`
- **Explanation:** 
  - Start with `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]`:
    - Remove numbers `1` and `4`, then `nums = [2, 3]`
    - Remove numbers `2` and `3`, then `nums = []`
  - There are no more pairs that sum up to `5`, hence a total of `2` operations.

#### Example 2

- **Input:** `nums = [3, 1, 3, 4, 3]`, `k = 6`
- **Output:** `1`
- **Explanation:** 
  - Start with `nums = [3, 1, 3, 4, 3]`:
    - Remove the first two `3's`, then `nums = [1, 4, 3]`
  - There are no more pairs that sum up to `6`, hence a total of `1` operation.

### Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `1 <= k <= 10^9`

## Solution

### Java Solution

The Java solution sorts the array and then uses two pointers to find pairs that sum to `k`. This approach ensures an efficient search for pairs.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int maxOperations(int[] nums, int k) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int i = 0;
        int j = nums.length - 1;
        int count = 0;
        while (i < j) {
            if (k - nums[i] == nums[j]) {
                count++;
                i++;
                j--;
            } else if (k - nums[i] < nums[j]) {
                j--;
            } else {
                i++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

### JavaScript Solution

The JavaScript solution follows the same logic as the Java solution. It sorts the array and uses two pointers to find pairs.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxOperations = function(nums, k) {
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    let i = 0, j = nums.length - 1, count = 0;

    while (i < j) {
        if (k - nums[i] === nums[j]) {
            count++;
            i++;
            j--;
        } else if (k - nums[i] < nums[j]) {
            j--;
        } else {
            i++;
        }
    }
    return count;
};
```

## Approach

### Intuition

To find the maximum number of operations that sum to `k`, we need to efficiently identify pairs of numbers whose sum equals `k`. Sorting the array helps simplify the search by allowing us to use two pointers.

### Steps

1. **Sort the Array:** 
   - Sorting the array enables efficient pair search using two pointers.

2. **Initialize Pointers:**
   - Use two pointers: `left` starting from the beginning and `right` from the end of the array.

3. **Find Pairs:**
   - Calculate the sum of elements at `left` and `right` pointers.
   - If the sum equals `k`, increment the count and move both pointers.
   - If the sum is less than `k`, move the `left` pointer to the right.
   - If the sum is greater than `k`, move the `right` pointer to the left.

4. **Repeat Until Pointers Meet:**
   - Continue the process until the `left` pointer is no longer less than the `right` pointer.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n \log n)\) due to the sorting step.
- The two-pointer traversal is \(O(n)\), making the overall complexity dominated by the sorting step.

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity is \(O(1)\) as no extra space is used apart from a few variables.

## Example and Dry Run

Let's go through a dry run of the JavaScript solution with Example 1:

**Input:** `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, `k = 5`
**Output:** `2`

### Steps

1. **Sort the Array:**
   - `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]`

2. **Initialize Pointers:**
   - `i = 0`, `j = 3`, `count = 0`

3. **Find Pairs:**
   - `1 + 4 = 5` -> `count = 1`, move `i` to `1`, `j` to `2`
   - `2 + 3 = 5` -> `count = 2`, move `i` to `2`, `j` to `1`

4. **Pointers Meet:**
   - `i` is no longer less than `j`, stop the process.

This demonstrates that the function works correctly for the given example.
