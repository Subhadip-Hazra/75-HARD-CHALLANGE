# Is Subsequence

## Problem Statement

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `s` is a subsequence of `t`, or `false` otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

### Examples

#### Example 1

- **Input:** `s = "abc"`, `t = "ahbgdc"`
- **Output:** `true`

#### Example 2

- **Input:** `s = "axc"`, `t = "ahbgdc"`
- **Output:** `false`

### Constraints

- `0 <= s.length <= 100`
- `0 <= t.length <= 10^4`
- `s` and `t` consist only of lowercase English letters.

## Solution

### Java Solution

The Java solution uses a two-pointer technique to iterate through both strings. It checks if the characters in `s` appear in `t` in the same order.

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isSubsequence(String s, String t) {
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        if (s.length() < 1) return true;
        while (i < t.length()) {
            if (t.charAt(i) == s.charAt(j)) {
                j++;
            }
            i++;
            if (j == s.length()) return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

### JavaScript Solution

The JavaScript solution follows the same logic as the Java solution. It uses two pointers to check if `s` is a subsequence of `t`.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {string} t
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isSubsequence = function(s, t) {
    let i = 0, j = 0;
    if (s.length < 1) return true;
    while (i < t.length) {
        if (s[j] === t[i]) {
            j++;
        }
        i++;
        if (j === s.length) return true;
    }
    return false;
};
```

## Approach

### Intuition

To determine if `s` is a subsequence of `t`, we need to ensure that all characters of `s` appear in `t` in the same order as they appear in `s`. We can achieve this using a two-pointer technique where one pointer iterates through `t` and the other through `s`.

### Steps

1. **Initialize Pointers:**
   - Initialize two pointers `i` and `j` to 0. Pointer `i` will traverse `t` and pointer `j` will traverse `s`.

2. **Iterate Through Strings:**
   - Traverse the string `t` using the pointer `i`.
   - If the character at `t[i]` matches the character at `s[j]`, increment the pointer `j`.
   - Increment the pointer `i`.

3. **Check Completion:**
   - If the pointer `j` equals the length of `s`, it means all characters of `s` were found in `t` in the correct order. Return `true`.
   - If the loop completes without matching all characters of `s`, return `false`.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of the solution is \(O(n)\), where `n` is the length of string `t`. This is because we traverse the string `t` once.

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity is \(O(1)\) as the algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space.

## Example and Dry Run

Let's go through a dry run of the JavaScript solution with Example 1:

**Input:** `s = "abc"`, `t = "ahbgdc"`
**Output:** `true`

### Steps

1. **Initialization:**
   - `i = 0`, `j = 0`

2. **Iterate Through `t`:**
   - `t[0] = 'a'` matches `s[0] = 'a'`, increment `j`. Now `j = 1`.
   - `t[1] = 'h'` does not match `s[1] = 'b'`, increment `i`.
   - `t[2] = 'b'` matches `s[1] = 'b'`, increment `j`. Now `j = 2`.
   - `t[3] = 'g'` does not match `s[2] = 'c'`, increment `i`.
   - `t[4] = 'd'` does not match `s[2] = 'c'`, increment `i`.
   - `t[5] = 'c'` matches `s[2] = 'c'`, increment `j`. Now `j = 3`.

3. **Check Completion:**
   - Since `j` equals the length of `s`, return `true`.

This demonstrates that the function works correctly for the given example.
