# Dota2 Senate Victory Predictor

## Problem Statement

In the world of Dota2, there are two parties: the Radiant and the Dire. The Dota2 senate consists of senators coming from these two parties. The Senate wants to decide on a change in the Dota2 game through a round-based voting procedure. 

Each senator can exercise one of the two rights in each round:
1. **Ban one senator's right:** A senator can make another senator lose all his rights in this and all the following rounds.
2. **Announce the victory:** If a senator finds that all senators who still have voting rights are from the same party, they can announce the victory and decide on the change in the game.

Given a string `senate` representing each senator's party affiliation (with 'R' for Radiant and 'D' for Dire), predict which party will finally announce the victory.

### Examples

#### Example 1

**Input:** 
```
senate = "RD"
```
**Output:** 
```
"Radiant"
```
**Explanation:** 
- The first senator is from Radiant and can ban the next senator's right in round 1.
- The second senator (Dire) cannot exercise any rights anymore as his rights have been banned.
- In round 2, the first senator (Radiant) can announce the victory as they are the only senator left with voting rights.

#### Example 2

**Input:**
```
senate = "RDD"
```
**Output:** 
```
"Dire"
```
**Explanation:** 
- The first senator is from Radiant and can ban the next senator's right in round 1.
- The second senator (Dire) cannot exercise any rights anymore as his rights have been banned.
- The third senator (Dire) can ban the first senator's (Radiant) right in round 1.
- In round 2, the third senator (Dire) can announce the victory as they are the only senator left with voting rights.

### Constraints

- `n == senate.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^4`
- `senate[i]` is either 'R' or 'D'.

## Approach

To solve this problem, we can use two queues to keep track of the indices of the Radiant and Dire senators. During each round, we compare the indices of the front senators from both queues:
- The senator with the smaller index will ban the senator with the larger index.
- The winning senator gets re-enqueued with a new index increased by the length of the senate string `n`.

This process continues until one of the queues is empty, at which point the party with remaining senators wins.

## Solutions

### Java Solution

Here's the Java implementation of the `predictPartyVictory` method:

```java
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

class Solution {
    public String predictPartyVictory(String senate) {
        Queue<Integer> rad = new LinkedList<>();
        Queue<Integer> dire = new LinkedList<>();

        int n = senate.length();

        for (int i = 0; i < senate.length(); i++) {
            if (senate.charAt(i) == 'R') {
                rad.add(i);
            } else {
                dire.add(i);
            }
        }

        while (!rad.isEmpty() && !dire.isEmpty()) {
            if (rad.peek() < dire.peek()) {
                rad.add(n++);
            } else {
                dire.add(n++);
            }

            rad.poll();
            dire.poll();
        }

        return (rad.isEmpty()) ? "Dire" : "Radiant";
    }
}

/**
 * Usage example:
 * Solution sol = new Solution();
 * System.out.println(sol.predictPartyVictory("RDD")); // Output: Dire
 */
```

### JavaScript Solution

Here's the JavaScript implementation of the `predictPartyVictory` method:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} senate
 * @return {string}
 */
var predictPartyVictory = function(senate) {
    let rad = [];
    let dire = [];

    let n = senate.length;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (senate[i] === 'R') {
            rad.push(i);
        } else {
            dire.push(i);
        }
    }

    while (rad.length && dire.length) {
        if (rad[0] < dire[0]) {
            rad.push(n++);
        } else {
            dire.push(n++);
        }

        rad.shift();
        dire.shift();
    }

    return !rad.length ? "Dire" : "Radiant";
};

/**
 * Usage example:
 * console.log(predictPartyVictory("RDD")); // Output: Dire
 */
```

## Explanation and Dry Run

### Java Solution Dry Run

1. **Initialization:**
   - `Queue<Integer> rad = new LinkedList<>();`
   - `Queue<Integer> dire = new LinkedList<>();`
   - For `senate = "RDD"`, enqueue indices: `rad = [0]`, `dire = [1, 2]`

2. **First Round:**
   - Compare indices: `rad.peek() = 0` vs `dire.peek() = 1`
   - `0 < 1`: Radiant wins, re-enqueue with new index `3`: `rad = [3]`
   - Remove banned senators: `rad.poll()`, `dire.poll()`

3. **Second Round:**
   - Compare indices: `rad.peek() = 3` vs `dire.peek() = 2`
   - `2 < 3`: Dire wins, re-enqueue with new index `4`: `dire = [4]`
   - Remove banned senators: `rad.poll()`, `dire.poll()`

4. **End:**
   - `rad` is empty, `dire` has remaining senators: Return "Dire"


## Conclusion

Both the Java and JavaScript solutions efficiently predict the victorious party using queues to manage the voting rounds and banning logic. The solutions ensure that operations are performed in \(O(n)\) time, making them suitable for the given constraints.
