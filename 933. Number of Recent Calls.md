# Number of Recent Calls

## Problem Statement

You have a `RecentCounter` class which counts the number of recent requests within a certain time frame.

Implement the `RecentCounter` class:

- `RecentCounter()` Initializes the counter with zero recent requests.
- `int ping(int t)` Adds a new request at time `t`, where `t` represents some time in milliseconds, and returns the number of requests that have happened in the past 3000 milliseconds (including the new request). Specifically, return the number of requests that have happened in the inclusive range `[t - 3000, t]`.

It is guaranteed that every call to `ping` uses a strictly larger value of `t` than the previous call.

### Examples

#### Example 1

**Input:**
```
["RecentCounter", "ping", "ping", "ping", "ping"]
[[], [1], [100], [3001], [3002]]
```

**Output:**
```
[null, 1, 2, 3, 3]
```

**Explanation:**
```
RecentCounter recentCounter = new RecentCounter();
recentCounter.ping(1);     // requests = [1], range is [-2999, 1], return 1
recentCounter.ping(100);   // requests = [1, 100], range is [-2900, 100], return 2
recentCounter.ping(3001);  // requests = [1, 100, 3001], range is [1, 3001], return 3
recentCounter.ping(3002);  // requests = [1, 100, 3001, 3002], range is [2, 3002], return 3
```

### Constraints

- \(1 \leq t \leq 10^9\)
- Each test case will call `ping` with strictly increasing values of `t`.
- At most \(10^4\) calls will be made to `ping`.

## Approach

To solve this problem, we need a data structure that can efficiently manage the incoming requests and ensure that we only count the requests that fall within the last 3000 milliseconds. A queue is an ideal choice for this purpose because it allows us to efficiently add new requests and remove outdated requests.

### Steps

1. **Initialization:** 
   - Use a queue to store the timestamps of incoming requests.
   - Initialize the queue in the constructor.

2. **Adding a New Request:**
   - When a new request with timestamp `t` is added, push `t` into the queue.
   - Remove all timestamps from the front of the queue that are older than `t - 3000`.

3. **Returning the Count:**
   - After removing outdated requests, the size of the queue gives the number of requests within the last 3000 milliseconds.

## Solutions

### Java Solution

Here's the Java implementation of the `RecentCounter` class:

```java
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

class RecentCounter {
    Queue<Integer> q;

    public RecentCounter() {
        q = new LinkedList<>();
    }

    public int ping(int t) {
        q.add(t);
        while (q.peek() < t - 3000) {
            q.poll();
        }
        return q.size();
    }
}

/**
 * Your RecentCounter object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * RecentCounter obj = new RecentCounter();
 * int param_1 = obj.ping(t);
 */
```

### JavaScript Solution

Here's the JavaScript implementation of the `RecentCounter` class:

```javascript
var RecentCounter = function() {
    this.q = [];
};

/** 
 * @param {number} t
 * @return {number}
 */
RecentCounter.prototype.ping = function(t) {
    this.q.push(t);
    while (this.q[0] < t - 3000) {
        this.q.shift();
    }
    return this.q.length;
};

/** 
 * Your RecentCounter object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * var obj = new RecentCounter()
 * var param_1 = obj.ping(t)
 */
```

## Explanation and Dry Run

### Java Solution Dry Run

1. **Initialization:**
   - Create an instance: `RecentCounter recentCounter = new RecentCounter();`
   - `q = []`

2. **Ping Requests:**

   - **ping(1):**
     - Add 1 to the queue: `q = [1]`
     - No outdated requests to remove.
     - Return size: `1`

   - **ping(100):**
     - Add 100 to the queue: `q = [1, 100]`
     - No outdated requests to remove.
     - Return size: `2`

   - **ping(3001):**
     - Add 3001 to the queue: `q = [1, 100, 3001]`
     - Remove 1 (outdated): `q = [100, 3001]`
     - Return size: `2`

   - **ping(3002):**
     - Add 3002 to the queue: `q = [100, 3001, 3002]`
     - No outdated requests to remove.
     - Return size: `3`

## Conclusion

Both the Java and JavaScript solutions efficiently manage the recent requests using a queue, ensuring that the operations for adding and removing timestamps are performed in \(O(1)\) time. This makes the solutions scalable and efficient even for the maximum constraints.
