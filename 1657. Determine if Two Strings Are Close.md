# Determine if Two Strings Are Close

## Problem Statement

Two strings are considered close if you can attain one from the other using the following operations:

1. **Operation 1:** Swap any two existing characters.
   - For example, `abcde -> aecdb`
2. **Operation 2:** Transform every occurrence of one existing character into another existing character, and do the same with the other character.
   - For example, `aacabb -> bbcbaa` (all `a`s turn into `b`s, and all `b`s turn into `a`s)

You can use the operations on either string as many times as necessary.

Given two strings, `word1` and `word2`, return `true` if `word1` and `word2` are close, and `false` otherwise.

### Examples

#### Example 1

- **Input:** `word1 = "abc"`, `word2 = "bca"`
- **Output:** `true`
- **Explanation:** You can attain `word2` from `word1` in 2 operations.
  - Apply Operation 1: `abc -> acb`
  - Apply Operation 1: `acb -> bca`

#### Example 2

- **Input:** `word1 = "a"`, `word2 = "aa"`
- **Output:** `false`
- **Explanation:** It is impossible to attain `word2` from `word1`, or vice versa, in any number of operations.

#### Example 3

- **Input:** `word1 = "cabbba"`, `word2 = "abbccc"`
- **Output:** `true`
- **Explanation:** You can attain `word2` from `word1` in 3 operations.
  - Apply Operation 1: `cabbba -> caabbb`
  - Apply Operation 2: `caabbb -> baaccc`
  - Apply Operation 2: `baaccc -> abbccc`

### Constraints

- \(1 \leq word1.length, word2.length \leq 10^5\)
- `word1` and `word2` contain only lowercase English letters.

## Solutions

### Java Solution

The Java solution involves counting the frequency of each character in both strings, checking for matching character sets, and comparing the sorted frequency arrays.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public boolean closeStrings(String word1, String word2) {
        int[] freq1 = new int[26];
        int[] freq2 = new int[26];

        for (int i = 0; i < word1.length(); ++i) {
            freq1[word1.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < word2.length(); ++i) {
            freq2[word2.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < 26; ++i) {
             if ((freq1[i] > 0 && freq2[i] == 0) || (freq2[i] > 0 && freq1[i] == 0)) {
                 return false; 
             }
        }

        Arrays.sort(freq1);
        Arrays.sort(freq2);

        for (int i = 0; i < 26; ++i) {
            if (freq1[i] != freq2[i]) {
                return false; 
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

### JavaScript Solution

The JavaScript solution also uses frequency counting, set comparison, and sorting of frequency arrays to determine if the strings are close.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} word1
 * @param {string} word2
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var closeStrings = function(word1, word2) {
        let freq1 = new Array(26).fill(0);
        let freq2 = new Array(26).fill(0);

        for (let i = 0; i < word1.length; ++i) {
            freq1[word1.charCodeAt(i) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)]++;
        }

        for (let i = 0; i < word2.length; ++i) {
            freq2[word2.charCodeAt(i) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)]++;
        }

        for (let i = 0; i < 26; ++i) {
            if ((freq1[i] > 0 && freq2[i] === 0) || (freq2[i] > 0 && freq1[i] === 0)) {
                return false; 
            }
        }

        freq1.sort((a, b) => a - b);
        freq2.sort((a, b) => a - b);

        for (let i = 0; i < 26; ++i) {
            if (freq1[i] !== freq2[i]) {
                return false; 
            }
        }
        return true;
};
```

## Approach

### Intuition

To determine if two strings are close, we need to ensure that:
1. Both strings have the same set of unique characters.
2. The frequency of these characters can be rearranged to match each other.

### Steps

1. **Count Frequencies:**
   - Count the frequency of each character in both strings using an array of size 26 (for the 26 lowercase English letters).

2. **Check Unique Characters:**
   - Ensure that both strings contain the same unique characters. If one string has a character that the other doesn't, return `false`.

3. **Compare Frequency Arrays:**
   - Sort the frequency arrays of both strings.
   - Compare the sorted frequency arrays element by element. If they are identical, return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the longer string. This is due to the sorting step.

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity is \(O(1)\) since the frequency arrays have a fixed size of 26.

## Example and Dry Run

Let's go through a dry run of both the Java and JavaScript solutions with Example 1:

**Input:** `word1 = "abc"`, `word2 = "bca"`
**Output:** `true`

### Dry Run

**Initialization:**
- `freq1 = [0, 0, 0, ..., 0]`
- `freq2 = [0, 0, 0, ..., 0]`

**Counting Frequencies:**
1. Process `a` in `word1`: `freq1 = [1, 0, 0, ..., 0]`
2. Process `b` in `word1`: `freq1 = [1, 1, 0, ..., 0]`
3. Process `c` in `word1`: `freq1 = [1, 1, 1, ..., 0]`

1. Process `b` in `word2`: `freq2 = [0, 1, 0, ..., 0]`
2. Process `c` in `word2`: `freq2 = [0, 1, 1, ..., 0]`
3. Process `a` in `word2`: `freq2 = [1, 1, 1, ..., 0]`

**Checking Unique Characters:**
- Both `freq1` and `freq2` have non-zero values at the same indices, so proceed.

**Sorting and Comparing Frequencies:**
- Sorted `freq1 = [0, 0, 0, ..., 1, 1, 1]`
- Sorted `freq2 = [0, 0, 0, ..., 1, 1, 1]`

Since sorted `freq1` equals sorted `freq2`, return `true`.

## Conclusion

The provided solutions efficiently determine whether two strings are close by comparing the frequency of characters and ensuring both strings contain the same unique characters. Both the Java and JavaScript implementations use frequency arrays and sorting to achieve this

 with optimal time and space complexity.
