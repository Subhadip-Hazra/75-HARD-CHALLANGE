# Can Place Flowers

## Problem Statement

You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots.

Given an integer array `flowerbed` containing `0`s and `1`s, where `0` means empty and `1` means not empty, and an integer `n`, return `true` if `n` new flowers can be planted in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and `false` otherwise.

### Examples

#### Example 1

- **Input:** `flowerbed = [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]`, `n = 1`
- **Output:** `true`

#### Example 2

- **Input:** `flowerbed = [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]`, `n = 2`
- **Output:** `false`

### Constraints

- `1 <= flowerbed.length <= 2 * 10^4`
- `flowerbed[i]` is `0` or `1`.
- There are no two adjacent flowers in `flowerbed`.
- `0 <= n <= flowerbed.length`

## Solution

### Java

The Java solution involves iterating through the flowerbed array and checking if a flower can be planted at the current position based on the rules provided. If a flower can be planted, we place it and decrement `n`. Finally, we return `true` if all flowers are planted (`n <= 0`), otherwise, `false`.

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canPlaceFlowers(int[] flowerbed, int n) {
        for (int i = 0; i < flowerbed.length; i++) {
            if (flowerbed[i] == 0 && (i == 0 || flowerbed[i - 1] == 0) && (i == flowerbed.length - 1 || flowerbed[i + 1] == 0)) {
                flowerbed[i] = 1;
                n--;
            }
        }
        return n <= 0;
    }
}
```

### JavaScript

The JavaScript solution follows the same logic as the Java solution. We iterate through the flowerbed array, check if a flower can be planted at each position, and update the flowerbed and `n` accordingly.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} flowerbed
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var canPlaceFlowers = function(flowerbed, n) {
    const m = flowerbed.length;
    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        if (flowerbed[i] == 0 && (i == 0 || flowerbed[i - 1] == 0) && (i == m - 1 || flowerbed[i + 1] == 0)) {
            flowerbed[i] = 1;
            n--;
        }
    }
    return n <= 0;
};
```

## Approach

### Intuition

To determine if we can plant `n` flowers in the given flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule, we need to check each position in the flowerbed and ensure that it and its neighbors are empty before planting a flower there.

### Steps

1. **Initialization:**
   - Traverse the `flowerbed` array.

2. **Check Planting Conditions:**
   - For each position `i`:
     - Check if the current plot is empty (`flowerbed[i] == 0`).
     - Check if the left neighbor is empty or if it is the first plot (`i == 0 || flowerbed[i - 1] == 0`).
     - Check if the right neighbor is empty or if it is the last plot (`i == flowerbed.length - 1 || flowerbed[i + 1] == 0`).
   - If all conditions are met, plant a flower (`flowerbed[i] = 1`) and decrement `n`.

3. **Return Result:**
   - If `n` is less than or equal to 0 after the loop, return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of the solution is \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the length of the flowerbed array, as we are traversing the array once.

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity is \(O(1)\) since we are modifying the input array in place and using a constant amount of extra space.

## Conclusion

This approach ensures that we efficiently determine whether we can plant the required number of flowers in the flowerbed without violating the given rules. The implementation is straightforward and maintains both time and space efficiency.

## Dry Run

Let's go through a dry run of the JavaScript solution with Example 1:

**Input:** `flowerbed = [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]`, `n = 1`
**Output:** `true`

### Steps

1. **Initialization:**
   - `flowerbed = [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]`
   - `n = 1`
   - `m = 5`

2. **Iteration:**

   - **i = 0:**
     - `flowerbed[0] == 1` (not empty), so continue to next iteration.
   
   - **i = 1:**
     - `flowerbed[1] == 0` (empty)
     - `i == 0 || flowerbed[0] == 0` (left neighbor is not empty, but `i` is not 0)
     - `i == m - 1 || flowerbed[2] == 0` (right neighbor is empty)
     - Conditions not met, continue to next iteration.
   
   - **i = 2:**
     - `flowerbed[2] == 0` (empty)
     - `i == 0 || flowerbed[1] == 0` (left neighbor is empty)
     - `i == m - 1 || flowerbed[3] == 0` (right neighbor is empty)
     - Conditions met, plant a flower:
       - `flowerbed = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]`
       - `n = 0`

   - **i = 3:**
     - `flowerbed[3] == 0` (empty), but `n == 0`, so we don't need to plant more flowers.
   
   - **i = 4:**
     - `flowerbed[4] == 1` (not empty), so continue to next iteration.

3. **Return Result:**
   - Since `n <= 0`, return `true`.

This concludes the dry run, demonstrating that the function works correctly for the given example.
