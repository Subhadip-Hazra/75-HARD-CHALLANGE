# Find the Difference of Two Arrays

## Problem Statement

Given two 0-indexed integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return a list `answer` of size 2 where:

- `answer[0]` is a list of all distinct integers in `nums1` which are not present in `nums2`.
- `answer[1]` is a list of all distinct integers in `nums2` which are not present in `nums1`.

Note that the integers in the lists may be returned in any order.

### Examples

#### Example 1

- **Input:** `nums1 = [1,2,3]`, `nums2 = [2,4,6]`
- **Output:** `[[1,3],[4,6]]`
- **Explanation:**
  - For `nums1`, `nums1[1] = 2` is present at index 0 of `nums2`, whereas `nums1[0] = 1` and `nums1[2] = 3` are not present in `nums2`. Therefore, `answer[0] = [1,3]`.
  - For `nums2`, `nums2[0] = 2` is present at index 1 of `nums1`, whereas `nums2[1] = 4` and `nums2[2] = 6` are not present in `nums1`. Therefore, `answer[1] = [4,6]`.

#### Example 2

- **Input:** `nums1 = [1,2,3,3]`, `nums2 = [1,1,2,2]`
- **Output:** `[[3],[]]`
- **Explanation:**
  - For `nums1`, `nums1[2]` and `nums1[3]` are not present in `nums2`. Since `nums1[2] == nums1[3]`, their value is only included once and `answer[0] = [3]`.
  - Every integer in `nums2` is present in `nums1`. Therefore, `answer[1] = []`.

### Constraints

- `1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 1000`
- `-1000 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000`

## Solutions

### Java Solution

The Java solution utilizes sets to determine the unique elements present in one array and not the other.

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> findDifference(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        Set<Integer> set1 = new HashSet<>();
        Set<Integer> set2 = new HashSet<>();

        for (int i : nums1) {
            set1.add(i);
        }

        for (int i : nums2) {
            set2.add(i);
        }

        List<List<Integer>> res = new ArrayList<>();
        List<Integer> ans = new ArrayList<>(set1);
        List<Integer> ans1 = new ArrayList<>(set2);

        ans.removeAll(set2);
        ans1.removeAll(set1);

        res.add(ans);
        res.add(ans1);

        return res;
    }
}
```

### JavaScript Solution

The JavaScript solution also leverages sets to find the unique elements in each array and computes the differences using array filtering.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums1
 * @param {number[]} nums2
 * @return {number[][]}
 */
var findDifference = function(nums1, nums2) {
    // Create sets for both arrays
    const set1 = new Set(nums1);
    const set2 = new Set(nums2);

    // Function to get difference between two sets
    const difference = (setA, setB) => {
        return Array.from(setA).filter(x => !setB.has(x));
    };

    // Find differences
    const ans1 = difference(set1, set2);
    const ans2 = difference(set2, set1);

    // Return result as a list of lists
    return [ans1, ans2];
};
```

## Approach

### Intuition

The goal is to find elements that are unique to each array compared to the other. Using sets helps to efficiently manage and find these unique elements.

### Steps

1. **Convert Arrays to Sets:**
   - Convert `nums1` and `nums2` to sets to get unique elements.

2. **Find Differences:**
   - Use set operations to find elements in `set1` not in `set2` and vice versa.

3. **Prepare Result:**
   - Collect the differences into two separate lists and return them as a list of lists.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity for both solutions is \(O(n + m)\), where \(n\) is the length of `nums1` and \(m\) is the length of `nums2`, due to the operations of converting arrays to sets and performing set operations.

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity is \(O(n + m)\) due to the storage requirements for the sets.

## Conclusion

The problem of finding the difference between two arrays can be efficiently solved using sets. Both the Java and JavaScript solutions provided demonstrate this approach, ensuring optimal performance and minimal space usage. By converting the arrays to sets and using set operations, we can easily determine the unique elements in each array and return the required result.
