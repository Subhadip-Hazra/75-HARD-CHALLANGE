# String Compression

## Problem Statement

Given an array of characters `chars`, compress it using the following algorithm:

1. Begin with an empty string `s`.
2. For each group of consecutive repeating characters in `chars`:
   - If the group's length is 1, append the character to `s`.
   - Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length.
3. The compressed string `s` should not be returned separately, but instead, be stored in the input character array `chars`. Note that group lengths that are 10 or longer will be split into multiple characters in `chars`.
4. After you are done modifying the input array, return the new length of the array.

You must write an algorithm that uses only constant extra space.

### Examples

#### Example 1

- **Input:** `chars = ["a", "a", "b", "b", "c", "c", "c"]`
- **Output:** `Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a", "2", "b", "2", "c", "3"]`
- **Explanation:** The groups are "aa", "bb", and "ccc". This compresses to "a2b2c3".

#### Example 2

- **Input:** `chars = ["a"]`
- **Output:** `Return 1, and the first character of the input array should be: ["a"]`
- **Explanation:** The only group is "a", which remains uncompressed since it's a single character.

#### Example 3

- **Input:** `chars = ["a", "b", "b", "b", "b", "b", "b", "b", "b", "b", "b", "b", "b"]`
- **Output:** `Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: ["a", "b", "1", "2"]`
- **Explanation:** The groups are "a" and "bbbbbbbbbbbb". This compresses to "ab12".

### Constraints

- `1 <= chars.length <= 2000`
- `chars[i]` is a lowercase English letter, uppercase English letter, digit, or symbol.

## Solution

### Java Solution

The Java solution uses a `StringBuilder` to construct the compressed string. It iterates through the character array, counting consecutive repeating characters and appending the appropriate characters and counts to the `StringBuilder`. Finally, it updates the original character array with the compressed characters and returns the new length.

```java
class Solution {
    public int compress(char[] chars) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        int count = 1;
        for(int i = 1; i <= chars.length; i++) {
            if (i < chars.length && chars[i] == chars[i - 1]) {
                count++;
            } else {
                sb.append(chars[i - 1]);
                if (count > 1) {
                    sb.append(count);
                }
                count = 1;
            }
        }
        String str = sb.toString();
        for (int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++) {
            chars[i] = str.charAt(i);
        }
        return str.length();
    }
}
```

### JavaScript Solution

The JavaScript solution follows a similar approach. It constructs the compressed string by iterating through the character array, counting consecutive repeating characters, and appending the appropriate characters and counts to a result string. It then updates the original character array with the compressed characters and returns the new length.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {character[]} chars
 * @return {number}
 */
var compress = function(chars) {
    let res = "";
    let count = 1;
    for (let i = 1; i <= chars.length; i++) {
        if (i < chars.length && chars[i - 1] === chars[i]) {
            count++;
        } else {
            res += chars[i - 1];
            if (count > 1) {
                res += count;
            }
            count = 1;
        }
    }
    for (let i = 0; i < res.length; i++) {
        chars[i] = res.charAt(i);
    }
    return res.length;
};
```

## Approach

### Intuition

To compress the character array efficiently, we need to track consecutive repeating characters and their counts. This can be achieved by traversing the array and comparing each character with the previous one. If they are the same, we increment the count. Otherwise, we append the character and its count (if greater than 1) to the result.

### Steps

1. **Initialization:**
   - Use a `StringBuilder` (Java) or a result string (JavaScript) to build the compressed string.
   - Initialize a counter to keep track of consecutive repeating characters.

2. **Traversal:**
   - Iterate through the character array.
   - Compare the current character with the previous one.
   - If they are the same, increment the counter.
   - If they are different, append the previous character and its count (if greater than 1) to the result, and reset the counter.

3. **Update Original Array:**
   - Convert the result to a string.
   - Update the original character array with the compressed string.

4. **Return New Length:**
   - Return the length of the compressed string.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity is \(O(n)\) because we traverse the array once.

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity is \(O(1)\) for extra space, as we only use variables to store temporary data.

## Example and Dry Run

Let's go through a dry run of the JavaScript solution with Example 1:

**Input:** `chars = ["a", "a", "b", "b", "c", "c", "c"]`
**Output:** `6`
**Modified Array:** `["a", "2", "b", "2", "c", "3"]`

### Steps

1. **Initialization:**
   - `res = ""`
   - `count = 1`

2. **Traversal:**
   - For `i = 1`: `chars[i] = "a"` (same as `chars[i-1]`), `count = 2`
   - For `i = 2`: `chars[i] = "b"` (different from `chars[i-1]`), `res = "a2"`, `count = 1`
   - For `i = 3`: `chars[i] = "b"` (same as `chars[i-1]`), `count = 2`
   - For `i = 4`: `chars[i] = "c"` (different from `chars[i-1]`), `res = "a2b2"`, `count = 1`
   - For `i = 5`: `chars[i] = "c"` (same as `chars[i-1]`), `count = 2`
   - For `i = 6`: `chars[i] = "c"` (same as `chars[i-1]`), `count = 3`
   - For `i = 7`: end of array, `res = "a2b2c3"`

3. **Update Original Array:**
   - Update `chars` with the characters in `res`

4. **Return New Length:**
   - Return `res.length`, which is `6`

This demonstrates that the function works correctly for the given example.
