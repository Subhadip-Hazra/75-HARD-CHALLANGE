# Decode String

## Problem Statement

Given an encoded string, return its decoded string.

The encoding rule is: `k[encoded_string]`, where the `encoded_string` inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly `k` times. Note that `k` is guaranteed to be a positive integer.

You may assume that the input string is always valid; there are no extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc. Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, `k`. For example, there will not be input like `3a` or `2[4]`.

The test cases are generated so that the length of the output will never exceed \(10^5\).

### Examples

#### Example 1

- **Input:** `s = "3[a]2[bc]"`
- **Output:** `"aaabcbc"`
- **Explanation:**
  - "3[a]" becomes "aaa".
  - "2[bc]" becomes "bcbc".
  - Concatenating these results gives "aaabcbc".

#### Example 2

- **Input:** `s = "3[a2[c]]"`
- **Output:** `"accaccacc"`
- **Explanation:**
  - "a2[c]" becomes "acc".
  - "3[acc]" becomes "accaccacc".

#### Example 3

- **Input:** `s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef"`
- **Output:** `"abcabccdcdcdef"`
- **Explanation:**
  - "2[abc]" becomes "abcabc".
  - "3[cd]" becomes "cdcdcd".
  - Concatenating these results gives "abcabccdcdcdef".

### Constraints

- \(1 \leq s.length \leq 30\)
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters, digits, and square brackets `'[]'`.
- `s` is guaranteed to be a valid input.
- All the integers in `s` are in the range `[1, 300]`.

## Solutions

### Java Solution

The Java solution uses two stacks to manage numbers and strings during the decoding process. Here's the detailed implementation:

```java
import java.util.Stack;

class Solution {
    public String decodeString(String s) {
        Stack<Integer> numbers = new Stack<>();
        Stack<String> result = new Stack<>();
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        int i = 0;

        while (i < s.length()) {
            char ch = s.charAt(i);

            if (Character.isDigit(ch)) {
                int number = 0;
                while (Character.isDigit(s.charAt(i))) {
                    number = number * 10 + (s.charAt(i) - '0');
                    i++;
                }
                numbers.push(number);
            } else if (ch == '[') {
                result.push(sb.toString());
                sb.setLength(0);
                i++;
            } else if (ch == ']') {
                String str = sb.toString();
                sb.setLength(0);
                sb.append(result.pop());
                int number = numbers.pop();
                for (int j = 0; j < number; j++) {
                    sb.append(str);
                }
                i++;
            } else {
                sb.append(ch);
                i++;
            }
        }

        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```

### JavaScript Solution

The JavaScript solution similarly uses two stacks to handle numbers and strings. Here's the detailed implementation:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string}
 */
var decodeString = function(s) {
    let numbers = [];
    let result = [];
    let res = "";
    let i = 0;

    function isDigit(ch) {
        return ch >= '0' && ch <= '9';
    }

    while (i < s.length) {
        let ch = s[i];
        if (isDigit(ch)) {
            let number = 0;
            while (isDigit(s[i])) {
                number = number * 10 + (s[i] - '0');
                i++;
            }
            numbers.push(number);
        } else if (ch === '[') {
            result.push(res);
            res = "";
            i++;
        } else if (ch === ']') {
            let number = numbers.pop();
            let str = result.pop();
            for (let j = 0; j < number; j++) {
                str += res;
            }
            res = str;
            i++;
        } else {
            res += ch;
            i++;
        }
    }

    return res;
};
```

## Approach

### Intuition

The decoding process involves parsing the string and handling nested encoding rules. The use of stacks is ideal for this scenario as they allow us to manage and resolve nested patterns efficiently.

### Steps

1. **Initialization:**
   - Use two stacks: `numbers` to store repeat counts and `result` to store partial results.
   - Use a `StringBuilder` (in Java) or a string `res` (in JavaScript) to build the current decoded string.

2. **Traversal:**
   - Iterate over each character in the input string `s`.
   - If the character is a digit, compute the entire number and push it onto the `numbers` stack.
   - If the character is `'['`, push the current string onto the `result` stack and reset the current string.
   - If the character is `']'`, pop the repeat count from `numbers` and the previous string from `result`. Repeat the current string as per the count and append it to the previous string.
   - If the character is a letter, simply append it to the current string.

3. **Completion:**
   - After the traversal, the current string contains the fully decoded string.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity is \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the length of the input string. Each character is processed once.

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity is \( O(n) \), which accounts for the stack space used for numbers and results.

## Example and Dry Run

Let's go through a dry run of the Java solution with Example 1:

**Input:** `s = "3[a]2[bc]"`

### Java Dry Run

**Initialization:**
- `numbers = []`
- `result = []`
- `sb = ""`

**Processing:**
1. `ch = '3'` → `number = 3` → `numbers = [3]`
2. `ch = '['` → `result = [""]` → `sb = ""`
3. `ch = 'a'` → `sb = "a"`
4. `ch = ']'`
   - `number = 3` → `numbers = []`
   - `result.pop() = ""` → `result = []`
   - `sb = "aaa"`
5. `ch = '2'` → `number = 2` → `numbers = [2]`
6. `ch = '['` → `result = ["aaa"]` → `sb = ""`
7. `ch = 'b'` → `sb = "b"`
8. `ch = 'c'` → `sb = "bc"`
9. `ch = ']'`
   - `number = 2` → `numbers = []`
   - `result.pop() = "aaa"` → `result = []`
   - `sb = "aaabcbc"`

**Result:**
- `sb.toString() = "aaabcbc"`

## Conclusion

The provided solutions effectively decode strings encoded with nested patterns using stack-based approaches. Both Java and JavaScript implementations ensure optimal performance within the given constraints, guaranteeing that the resulting decoded string is computed efficiently and correctly.
