# Container With Most Water

## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `i-th` line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

### Examples

#### Example 1

![Example 1](https://i.postimg.cc/0jKVQwdP/question-11.jpg)

- **Input:** `height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]`
- **Output:** `49`
- **Explanation:** The above vertical lines are represented by array `[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]`. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is `49`.

#### Example 2

- **Input:** `height = [1,1]`
- **Output:** `1`

### Constraints

- `n == height.length`
- `2 <= n <= 10^5`
- `0 <= height[i] <= 10^4`

## Solution

### Java Solution

The Java solution uses a two-pointer technique to find the maximum area. The pointers start at the beginning and end of the array and move towards each other, calculating the area at each step.

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int max = 0;
        int left = 0;
        int right = height.length - 1;

        while (left < right) {
            int currentArea = (right - left) * Math.min(height[left], height[right]);
            max = Math.max(max, currentArea);

            if (height[left] < height[right]) {
                left++;
            } else {
                right--;
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```

### JavaScript Solution

The JavaScript solution follows the same logic as the Java solution. It uses two pointers to calculate the maximum area.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} height
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxArea = function(height) {
    let max = 0;
    let start = 0;
    let end = height.length - 1;
    while (start < end) {
        let area = (end - start) * Math.min(height[end], height[start]);
        max = Math.max(area, max);
        if (height[end] < height[start]) {
            end--;
        } else {
            start++;
        }
    }
    return max;
};
```

## Approach

### Intuition

To find the maximum amount of water a container can store, we need to maximize the area formed by the lines and the x-axis. The area is determined by the shorter line between the two selected lines and the distance between them.

### Steps

1. **Initialize Pointers:**
   - Start with two pointers, `left` at the beginning (index 0) and `right` at the end (index `height.length - 1`) of the array.

2. **Calculate Area:**
   - Calculate the area between the lines at `left` and `right` pointers.
   - Update the `max` area if the current area is greater.

3. **Move Pointers:**
   - Move the pointer that points to the shorter line towards the center. This is because the height of the shorter line limits the area, and moving it might give a chance to find a taller line which could potentially increase the area.

4. **Repeat:**
   - Continue the process until the `left` pointer is less than the `right` pointer.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\) because we traverse the array only once with two pointers.

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity is \(O(1)\) as we only use a constant amount of extra space.

## Example and Dry Run

Let's go through a dry run of the JavaScript solution with Example 1:

**Input:** `height = [1, 8, 6, 2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 7]`
**Output:** `49`

### Steps

1. **Initialization:**
   - `start = 0`, `end = 8`, `max = 0`

2. **Calculate Area:**
   - `area = (8 - 0) * Math.min(1, 7) = 8`
   - `max = Math.max(0, 8) = 8`

3. **Move Pointers:**
   - `height[start] < height[end]` so increment `start` to `1`.

4. **Calculate Area:**
   - `area = (8 - 1) * Math.min(8, 7) = 49`
   - `max = Math.max(8, 49) = 49`

5. **Move Pointers:**
   - `height[start] >= height[end]` so decrement `end` to `7`.

6. **Continue Process:**
   - Follow the same steps until `start` is less than `end`.

This demonstrates that the function works correctly for the given example.
