# Leaf-Similar Trees

## Problem Statement

Consider all the leaves of a binary tree. From left to right, the values of those leaves form a leaf value sequence.

Two binary trees are considered leaf-similar if their leaf value sequence is the same.

Write a function that returns `true` if and only if the two given trees with head nodes `root1` and `root2` are leaf-similar.

## Examples

### Example 1
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/zBNk8Wfr/tree.png" alt="ex1">

**Input:**
```
root1 = [3,5,1,6,2,9,8,null,null,7,4]
root2 = [3,5,1,6,7,4,2,null,null,null,null,null,null,9,8]
```

**Output:**
```
true
```

**Explanation:**
- The leaf value sequence for both trees is [6, 7, 4, 9, 8], so the trees are leaf-similar.

### Example 2

**Input:**
```
root1 = [1,2,3]
root2 = [1,3,2]
```

**Output:**
```
false
```

**Explanation:**
- The leaf value sequence for the first tree is [2, 3] and for the second tree is [3, 2], so the trees are not leaf-similar.

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in each tree is in the range [1, 200].
- Both trees have values in the range [0, 200].

## Solution

### Approach

To solve this problem, we need to traverse both trees and extract their leaf nodes' values. We then compare these sequences to determine if they are the same.

### Steps:

1. Traverse the tree to extract leaf node values.
2. Store these values in a list.
3. Compare the lists from both trees to check if they are identical.

### Java Solution

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public boolean leafSimilar(TreeNode root1, TreeNode root2) {
        List<Integer> leaves1 = new ArrayList<>();
        List<Integer> leaves2 = new ArrayList<>();

        getLeaves(root1, leaves1);
        getLeaves(root2, leaves2);

        return leaves1.equals(leaves2);
    }

    private void getLeaves(TreeNode root, List<Integer> leaves) {
        if (root == null) return;

        if (root.left == null && root.right == null) leaves.add(root.val);
        else {
            getLeaves(root.left, leaves);
            getLeaves(root.right, leaves);
        }
    }
}

/**
 * Usage example:
 * Solution sol = new Solution();
 * TreeNode root1 = new TreeNode(3, new TreeNode(5), new TreeNode(1));
 * TreeNode root2 = new TreeNode(3, new TreeNode(5), new TreeNode(1));
 * boolean result = sol.leafSimilar(root1, root2);
 * System.out.println(result);  // Output: true or false based on input
 */
```

### JavaScript Solution

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val);
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left);
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right);
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root1
 * @param {TreeNode} root2
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var leafSimilar = function(root1, root2) {
    let leaves1 = [];
    let leaves2 = [];

    getLeaves(root1, leaves1);
    getLeaves(root2, leaves2);

    return arraysEqual(leaves1, leaves2);
};

const getLeaves = (root, leaves) => {
    if (root === null) return;

    if (root.left === null && root.right === null) leaves.push(root.val);
    else {
        getLeaves(root.left, leaves);
        getLeaves(root.right, leaves);
    }
};

const arraysEqual = (leaves1, leaves2) => {
    if (leaves1.length !== leaves2.length) return false;
    for (let i = 0; i < leaves1.length; i++) {
        if (leaves1[i] !== leaves2[i]) return false;
    }
    return true;
};

/**
 * Usage example:
 * const root1 = new TreeNode(3, new TreeNode(5), new TreeNode(1));
 * const root2 = new TreeNode(3, new TreeNode(5), new TreeNode(1));
 * const result = leafSimilar(root1, root2);
 * console.log(result);  // Output: true or false based on input
 */
```

## Explanation and Dry Run

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Traversal and Leaf Collection:**
   - Traverse each tree and collect leaf node values in a list.
   - A leaf node is identified as a node with no left or right children.

2. **Comparison:**
   - Compare the leaf node value sequences of both trees.
   - If the sequences are identical, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

### Dry Run

#### Example 1

**Input:**
```
root1 = [3,5,1,6,2,9,8,null,null,7,4]
root2 = [3,5,1,6,7,4,2,null,null,null,null,null,null,9,8]
```

**Steps:**
1. Collect leaf values from `root1`: [6, 7, 4, 9, 8].
2. Collect leaf values from `root2`: [6, 7, 4, 9, 8].
3. Compare the two lists: [6, 7, 4, 9, 8] == [6, 7, 4, 9, 8] â†’ true.

## Conclusion

The provided Java and JavaScript solutions efficiently determine if two binary trees are leaf-similar by comparing their leaf value sequences. Both solutions have a time complexity of \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in each tree, and they operate within the constraints of the problem.
