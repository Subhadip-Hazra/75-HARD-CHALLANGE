# Asteroid Collision

## Problem Statement

We are given an array `asteroids` of integers representing asteroids in a row.

For each asteroid, the absolute value represents its size, and the sign represents its direction (positive meaning right, negative meaning left). Each asteroid moves at the same speed.

We need to find out the state of the asteroids after all collisions. If two asteroids meet, the smaller one will explode. If both are the same size, both will explode. Two asteroids moving in the same direction will never meet.

### Examples

#### Example 1

- **Input:** `asteroids = [5,10,-5]`
- **Output:** `[5,10]`
- **Explanation:** 
  - The `10` and `-5` collide resulting in `10`. 
  - The `5` and `10` never collide.

#### Example 2

- **Input:** `asteroids = [8,-8]`
- **Output:** `[]`
- **Explanation:** 
  - The `8` and `-8` collide, exploding each other.

#### Example 3

- **Input:** `asteroids = [10,2,-5]`
- **Output:** `[10]`
- **Explanation:** 
  - The `2` and `-5` collide resulting in `-5`. 
  - The `10` and `-5` collide resulting in `10`.

### Constraints

- \(2 \leq \text{asteroids.length} \leq 10^4\)
- \(-1000 \leq \text{asteroids}[i] \leq 1000\)
- \(\text{asteroids}[i] \neq 0\)

## Solutions

### Java Solution

The Java solution uses a stack to manage asteroid collisions. Here's the detailed implementation:

```java
import java.util.Stack;

class Solution {
    public int[] asteroidCollision(int[] asteroids) {
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();

        for (int asteroid : asteroids) {
            if (asteroid > 0) {
                stack.push(asteroid);
            } else {
                while (!stack.isEmpty() && stack.peek() > 0 && stack.peek() < Math.abs(asteroid)) {
                    stack.pop();
                }
                if (stack.isEmpty() || stack.peek() < 0) {
                    stack.push(asteroid);
                }
                if (stack.peek() == Math.abs(asteroid)) {
                    stack.pop();
                }
            }
        }

        int[] res = new int[stack.size()];
        int index = 0;
        for (int s : stack) {
            res[index++] = s;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

### JavaScript Solution

The JavaScript solution also uses a stack to efficiently manage collisions.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} asteroids
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var asteroidCollision = function(asteroids) {
    let stack = [];

    for (const asteroid of asteroids) {
        if (asteroid > 0) {
            stack.push(asteroid);
        } else {
            while (stack.length && stack[stack.length - 1] > 0 && stack[stack.length - 1] < Math.abs(asteroid)) {
                stack.pop();
            }
            if (stack.length === 0 || stack[stack.length - 1] < 0) {
                stack.push(asteroid);
            } else if (stack[stack.length - 1] === Math.abs(asteroid)) {
                stack.pop();
            }
        }
    }
    return stack;
};
```

## Approach

### Intuition

To determine the final state of the asteroids after all collisions, we can use a stack data structure:
1. Traverse through each asteroid in the input array.
2. If the current asteroid is moving to the right (positive value), push it onto the stack.
3. If the current asteroid is moving to the left (negative value), handle the collisions:
   - Pop asteroids from the stack while the top of the stack is a smaller right-moving asteroid.
   - If the stack is empty or contains a left-moving asteroid, push the current asteroid onto the stack.
   - If the top of the stack is a right-moving asteroid of the same size, pop the stack (both asteroids explode).

### Steps

1. **Initialize a Stack:** Use a stack to keep track of the remaining asteroids after each collision.
2. **Traverse the Asteroids:**
   - For each asteroid:
     - If it is moving right (positive value), push it onto the stack.
     - If it is moving left (negative value), handle the collision logic:
       - Pop smaller right-moving asteroids from the stack.
       - Push the current asteroid if the stack is empty or the top is a left-moving asteroid.
       - Pop the stack if the top is a right-moving asteroid of the same size.
3. **Build the Result:** Convert the stack to an array and return it.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity is \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the length of the asteroid array. Each asteroid is processed once.

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity is \( O(n) \) in the worst case, where no collisions occur and all asteroids are pushed onto the stack.

## Example and Dry Run

Let's go through a dry run of the Java solution with Example 1:

**Input:** `asteroids = [5,10,-5]`
**Output:** `[5,10]`

### Java Dry Run

**Initialization:**
- `stack = []`

**Processing:**
1. `asteroid = 5` → `stack = [5]`
2. `asteroid = 10` → `stack = [5, 10]`
3. `asteroid = -5`
   - `stack = [5, 10]` → `stack.peek() = 10`
   - Since `10 > 5`, no pop operation is performed.
   - `-5` collides with `10`, resulting in no changes to the stack.

**Result:**
- Convert `stack` to array: `[5, 10]`

## Conclusion

The provided solutions effectively manage asteroid collisions using a stack-based approach. Both Java and JavaScript implementations ensure optimal performance within the given constraints. This approach guarantees that the state of the asteroids after all collisions is determined efficiently and correctly.
